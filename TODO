-----------Pseudo Code--------------
Player Draw
TODO: for player draw make a loop that goes on each list in ["player"]["cards"]
TODO: and a nested one that uses if draw: 'continue' to keep drawing cards for said list

--Constants--
CARD_ROWS: number of rows
CARDS_INDEX: index of cards in hand list
SYMBOL_INDEX: index of symbols in hand list
CARDS_SYMBOLS: hold cards symbols
CARDS_LIST: hold game cards
HIDE_DEALER: bool used only to tell function to use only the first card


--Variables--
deck: copy of CARD_LIST
money: user money
user_hand: [
        [[card, card], [symbol, symbol]],
        [[card, card], [symbol, symbol]],
    ]
dealer_hand = [
              [[card, card], [symbol, symbol]],
    ]
user_hand_values = []: used for storing each hand values.
number_of_hands: will default to 1 and using add_hand() will add +1 to it. will be used to tell how many hands does the user have.


--Functions--
set_default_values: will copy CARDS_LIST to deck, user/dealer_hand = [[]], number_of_hands = 1, user_hand_values = []
add_hand: add another list to the user_hand and add +1 to number_of_hands.
first_draw: will draw and add a card to each player, user first.
shuffle_deck: shuffle the deck.
draw_card: (specific hand) draw one card for hand.
get_hand_value: (specific hand, hide_cards = False) calculate value and return it.
display_hand: (specific hand, hide_cards = False)  print hand, will also use get_hand_value().
display_value: (specific hand) might be used instead of using get_hand_value() inside of display_hand().
check_hand: (return of display_value()) check if hand is a bust or not.
conclusion: check each player value
--Game Loop--
start game => set_default_values() => first_draw() => display hands for each player, dealer first =>
display user choices:
1. "Hit" =>  draw_card(user_hand) => display_hand() => check_hand()
2. "Stand" => check_hand() for both players => conclusion()
3. "Split" [First turn of each hand only = only when hand is 2 cards] => split_hand() => draw_card() for first hand => repeat step 1-4 => conclusion().
4. "Double Down" [First turn of each hand only = only when hand is 2 cards] => draw_card(user_hand) => conclusion().

--Examples--
specific hand: ????_hand[hand_index]
hide_cards: will display only the first card when received HIDE_DEALER as argument, else will display all
