-----------Pseudo Code--------------
Player Draw
TODO: for player draw make a loop that goes on each list in ["player"]["cards"]
TODO: and a nested one that uses if draw: 'continue' to keep drawing cards for said list

--Constants--
CARD_ROWS: number of rows
CARDS_INDEX: index of cards in hand list
SYMBOL_INDEX: index of symbols in hand list
CARDS_SYMBOLS: hold cards symbols
CARDS_LIST: hold game cards
HIDE_DEALER: bool used only to tell function to use only the first card


--Variables--
deck = copy of CARD_LIST
money = user money
user_hand = {
        "values": [[card, card], [card, card]],
        "symbols": [[symbol, symbol], [symbol, symbol]],
    }
dealer_hand = {
        "values": [[card, card], [card, card]],
        "symbols": [[symbol, symbol], [symbol, symbol]],
    }
user_hand_values = []: used for storing each hand values.
number_of_hands = will default to 1 and using add_hand() will add +1 to it. will be used to tell how many hands does the user have.
user_current_hand_index = will be used as a ref to know which hand index we are using.

--Functions--
set_default_values: will copy CARDS_LIST to deck, user/dealer_hand = [[]], number_of_hands = 1, user_hand_values = []
add_hand: add another list to the user_hand and add +1 to number_of_hands.
first_draw:(specific hand) will draw and add a card to each player, user first.
shuffle_deck: shuffle the deck.
draw_card: (specific hand) draw one card for hand.
display_hand: (specific hand, hide_cards = False)  print hand, will also use get_hand_value().
display_value: (return of get_hand_value) display the value using the return of get_hand_value
display_players: (hide_dealer_hand = False) will get a boolean if there's a need to hide dealer's second card
get_hand_value: (specific hand, hide_cards = False) calculate value and return it.
check_hand: (return of display_value()) check if hand is a bust or not.
split_hand: (specific hand): will use add_hand() and transfer the second card to the new hand.
double_down: double bet and draw one card -> conclusion.
conclusion: check each player value.
--Game Loop--
start game => set_default_values() => first_draw() => display hands for each player, dealer first =>
display user choices:
1. "Hit" =>  draw_card(user_hand) => display_hand() => check_hand()
2. "Stand" => check_hand() for both players => conclusion()
3. "Split" [First turn of each hand only = only when hand is 2 cards] => split_hand() => draw_card() for first hand => repeat step 1-4 => conclusion().
4. "Double Down" [First turn of each hand only = only when hand is 2 cards] => draw_card(user_hand) => conclusion().

--Examples--
specific hand: hand + hand_index: default = 0
hide_cards: will display only the first card when received HIDE_DEALER as argument, else will display all
